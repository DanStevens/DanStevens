In some versions of the Bible, the word used is temperance, but that word is over 350 years old. In contemporary English today, "temperance" is often associated with abstinence from alcohol. However, the Greek word includes abstinence in every area of our lives. It not merely prohibits excessive indulgence in alcohol but just as much excessive indulgence in food, that is, gluttony or overeating.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><a10:link type="audio/mpeg" href="http://av1.w3e.subsplash.com/media/download/9S2SS4/LR15INT-010-5.mp3" /><a10:link rel="alternative" href="http://subspla.sh/4c085e6" /><a10:contributor><a10:name>Derek Prince Ministries</a10:name><a10:uri>http://www.derekprince.org</a10:uri><a10:email>ContactUs@derekprince.org</a10:email></a10:contributor></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">da760b6</guid><a10:author><a10:name>Derek Prince</a10:name></a10:author><category>Religion &amp; Spirituality</category><category>Christianity</category><title>Fruit of the Spirit (9): Gentleness</title><description>Today's fruit of the Spirit Derek is speaking about is the fruit of gentleness. The word in the original Greek can equally well be translated as meekness. Some versions use one word, some the other. We need to bear in mind that gentleness includes meekness and meekness includes gentleness. But meekness is not weakness, as many people think. But, the exact opposite is the true: meekness is the demonstration of strength.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><a10:link type="audio/mpeg" href="http://av1.w3e.subsplash.com/media/download/9S2SS4/LR15INT-010-4.mp3" /><a10:link rel="alternative" href="http://subspla.sh/da760b6" /><a10:contributor><a10:name>Derek Prince Ministries</a10:name><a10:uri>http://www.derekprince.org</a10:uri><a10:email>ContactUs@derekprince.org</a10:email></a10:contributor></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">92ee63c</guid><a10:author><a10:name>Derek Prince</a10:name></a10:author><category>Religion &amp; Spirituality</category><category>Christianity</category><title>Fruit of the Spirit (8): Faithfulness</title><description>Today Derek will speak about the fruit of faith or faithfulness. There are three types of faith: faith to live by, the gift of faith, and the fruit of faith, which is an aspect of character, something that must be carefully cultivated. In some versions of the Bible this is translated "faith," in others it's translated "faithfulness." These are like the two sides of one coin. On one side is depending-that's faith. On the other side being dependable-that's faithfulness.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><a10:link type="audio/mpeg" href="http://av1.w3e.subsplash.com/media/download/9S2SS4/LR15INT-010-3.mp3" /><a10:link rel="alternative" href="http://subspla.sh/92ee63c" /><a10:contributor><a10:name>Derek Prince Ministries</a10:name><a10:uri>http://www.derekprince.org</a10:uri><a10:email>ContactUs@derekprince.org</a10:email></a10:contributor></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">2461992</guid><a10:author><a10:name>Derek Prince</a10:name></a10:author><category>Religion &amp; Spirituality</category><category>Christianity</category><title>Fruit of the Spirit (7): Goodness</title><description>Today Derek Prince will be talking about the fruit of goodness. To understand this fruit, Derek first looks at the word good itself. One of the most common words in the English language, we have watered down this word by using it very cheaply and carelessly. In Scripture, however, the word denotes excellence, especially moral excellence. And in its strictest use, it applies only to God Himself.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><a10:link type="audio/mpeg" href="http://av1.w3e.subsplash.com/media/download/9S2SS4/LR15INT-010-2.mp3" /><a10:link rel="alternative" href="http://subspla.sh/2461992" /><a10:contributor><a10:name>Derek Prince Ministries</a10:name><a10:uri>http://www.derekprince.org</a10:uri><a10:email>ContactUs@derekprince.org</a10:email></a10:contributor></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">38fb8e9</guid><a10:author><a10:name>Derek Prince</a10:name></a10:author><category>Religion &amp; Spirituality</category><category>Christianity</category><title>Fruit of the Spirit (6): Kindness</title><description>The fruit of kindness is the first fruit of the Spirit Derek will speak about today. The essential nature of kindness is treating other people the way we would wish them to treat us. That makes kindness practical, easy to comprehend and, in a certain sense, easy to apply, because we usually know how we would like other people to treat us. In fact, we're very clear about that in our minds.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><a10:link type="audio/mpeg" href="http://av1.w3e.subsplash.com/media/download/9S2SS4/LR15INT-010-1.mp3" /><a10:link rel="alternative" href="http://subspla.sh/38fb8e9" /><a10:contributor><a10:name>Derek Prince Ministries</a10:name><a10:uri>http://www.derekprince.org</a10:uri><a10:email>ContactUs@derekprince.org</a10:email></a10:contributor></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">fbbf7da</guid><a10:author><a10:name>Derek Prince</a10:name></a10:author><category>Religion &amp; Spirituality</category><category>Christianity</category><title>Fruit of the Spirit (5): Patience</title><description>The fruit of patience includes two distinct, but related aspects of character. These are: steadfastness in enduring troubles and also slowness in avenging wrongs. Without both of these aspects, patience is incomplete. To have true, scriptural patience, you must combine both of these.</description><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><a10:link type="audio/mpeg" href="http://av1.w3e.subsplash.com/media/download/9S2SS4/LR15INT-009-5.mp3" /><a10:link rel="alternative" href="http://subspla.sh/fbbf7da" /><a10:contributor><a10:name>Derek Prince Ministries</a10:name><a10:uri>http://www.derekprince.org</a10:uri><a10:email>ContactUs@derekprince.org</a10:email></a10:contributor></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">e5c94b4</guid><a10:author><a10:name>Derek Prince</a10:name></a10:author><category>Religion &amp; Spirituality</category><category>Christianity</category><title>Fruit of the Spirit (4): Peace</title><description>The third form of the fruit of the Spirit is the fruit of peace. From the negative point of view, peace implies the absence of conflict. Certainly, there can be no peace where there is conflict. But to end conflict requires reconciliation. It is important to see that. True peace only comes, however, when two who are at opposition have been reconciled. Peace is made possible only through reconciliation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><a10:link type="audio/mpeg" href="http://av1.w3e.subsplash.com/media/download/9S2SS4/LR15INT-009-4.mp3" /><a10:link rel="alternative" href="http://subspla.sh/e5c94b4" /><a10:contributor><a10:name>Derek Prince Ministries</a10:name><a10:uri>http://www.derekprince.org</a10:uri><a10:email>ContactUs@derekprince.org</a10:email></a10:contributor></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">6a40b0a</guid><a10:author><a10:name>Derek Prince</a10:name></a10:author><category>Religion &amp; Spirituality</category><category>Christianity</category><title>Fruit of the Spirit (3): Joy</title><description>Today Derek tackles the second form of fruit, the fruit of joy. Joy is a beautiful word. When God blesses parents with a beautiful baby girl, a name they might choose for her is "Joy." Altogether, there is something beautiful about joy. However, in order to experience its beauty in our lives, we need to understand the real nature of joy. And, in order to understand that, we must know something about human personality.</description><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><a10:link type="audio/mpeg" href="http://av1.w3e.subsplash.com/media/download/9S2SS4/LR15INT-009-3.mp3" /><a10:link rel="alternative" href="http://subspla.sh/6a40b0a" /><a10:contributor><a10:name>Derek Prince Ministries</a10:name><a10:uri>http://www.derekprince.org</a10:uri><a10:email>ContactUs@derekprince.org</a10:email></a10:contributor></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">c1cbfdf</guid><a10:author><a10:name>Derek Prince</a10:name></a10:author><category>Religion &amp; Spirituality</category><category>Christianity</category><title>Fruit of the Spirit (2): Love</title><description>Today Derek will deal with the first form of fruit of the Holy Spirit, which is love. First of all, love is primary in the Christian faith. It occupies a place of importance that it shares with nothing else. Ultimately, all that really matters in the Christian life, Paul says, is faith expressing itself through love. External ordinances and rituals are of secondary importance. The center of your whole faith is expressed through love</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><a10:link type="audio/mpeg" href="http://av1.w3e.subsplash.com/media/download/9S2SS4/LR15INT-009-2.mp3" /><a10:link rel="alternative" href="http://subspla.sh/c1cbfdf" /><a10:contributor><a10:name>Derek Prince Ministries</a10:name><a10:uri>http://www.derekprince.org</a10:uri><a10:email>ContactUs@derekprince.org</a10:email></a10:contributor></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">1b8dd16</guid><a10:author><a10:name>Derek Prince</a10:name></a10:author><category>Religion &amp; Spirituality</category><category>Christianity</category><title>Fruit of the Spirit (1): How Fruit Comes</title><description>The fruit of the Spirit in nine forms is: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. In speaking about how fruit comes, Derek tells us that we need to bear in mind that both fruit and gifts are equally from the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit gives the gifts; the Holy Spirit also brings forth fruit. Both are equally the will of God</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2015 00:00:00 Z</pubDate><a10:link type="audio/mpeg" href="http://av1.w3e.subsplash.com/media/download/9S2SS4/LR15INT-009-1.mp3" /><a10:link rel="alternative" href="http://subspla.sh/1b8dd16" /><a10:contributor><a10:name>Derek Prince Ministries</a10:name><a10:uri>http://www.derekprince.org</a10:uri><a10:email>ContactUs@derekprince.org</a10:email></a10:contributor></item></channel></rss>
